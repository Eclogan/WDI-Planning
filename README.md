# WDI-Planning

(before the course)
- roles (do instructors teach equally)
- grading homework (divison of labor -1 person has 1 night, each instructor as x amount of students- frequency, feedback)
- 1:1s (structure, frequency)
- tools (which ones to use and who will make them: schoology, github, garnet, etc)
- install fest (we no longer support linux)
- curriculum
- daily and weekly schedule (morning activity, afternoon activity, outcome hours, labs)
- order of units
- order of lesson

(during the course)

Weekly planning meetings
     - who is going to teach what
     - in what order
     - confirm the learning objectives   (can be done later that day/week)
               does the learning objective make sense within the context of this lesson?
               does it fit within the unit (the story)?
               do we need to teach this?
               identify a hw that would work for your lesson and coordinate with the other instructor teaching that day

Every three weeks
     - check in with Leah and Nicole for how students are doing (on pace for outcomes and support)

Example Schedule: 
Monday planning hour (during morning exercise or lunch). Determine who is teaching what 
Wednesday (outcomes time) learning objective revist, and revisit objectives and finalize homeworks
