# WDI-Planning

(before the course)
roles (do instructors teach equally
morning ex.
grading homework (1 person has 1 night, each instructor as x amount of students, frequency, feedback)
1:1s (structure, frequency)
tools (which ones to use and who will make them)
install fest (we no longer support linux)

- curriculum
- daily and weekly schedule (morning activity, afternoon activity, outcome hours, labs)
- order of units
- order of lesson

(during the course)

Weekly planning meetings
     - who is going to teach
     - what order
     - confirm the learning objectives   (can be done later that day)
               does the learning objective make sense within the context of this lesson?
               does it fit within the unit (the story)?
               do we need to teach this?
               identify a hw that would work for your lesson

Every three weeks
     - check in with Leah and Nicole for how students are doing (on pace for outcomes and support)

Monday planning hour (morning exercise or lunch)
Wednesday (outcomes time) learning objective revist
